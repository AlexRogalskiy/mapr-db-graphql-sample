# Change Data Capture(CDC)

The Change Data Capture (CDC) system allows you to capture changes made to data records in MapR-DB tables 
(JSON or binary). These data changes are the result of inserts, updates, and deletions and are called change data 
records. Once the change data records are propagated to a topic, a MapR-ES/Kafka consumer application is used to read 
and process them.
